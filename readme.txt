when run as a python3 script, this program will prompt the user for a capacity parameter.
It will look in the local directory for a text file named data.txt with 2 integers per line,
with the first integer corresponding to a weight of a potential item and the second number corresponding to
that item's value. It will then compute the maximum value able to fit in the knapsack at or under the user-input capacity.
